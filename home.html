        <h2>History of Video Games</h2>
        <p>
          The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as computer
          scientists began designing simple games and simulations on
          minicomputers and mainframes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first consumer video game hardware was released in the early
          1970s. The first home video game console was the Magnavox Odyssey, and
          the first arcade video games were Computer Space and Pong. After its
          home console conversions, numerous companies sprang up to capture
          Pong's success in both the arcade and the home by cloning the game,
          causing a series of boom and bust cycles due to oversaturation and
          lack of innovation
        </p>
        <p>
          By the mid-1970s, low-cost programmable microprocessors replaced the
          discrete transistor transistor logic circuitry of early hardware, and
          the first ROM cartridge-based home consoles arrived, including the
          Atari Video Computer System (VCS). Coupled with rapid growth in the
          golden age of arcade video games, including Space Invaders and
          Pac-Man, the home console market also flourished.

          A video game, also known as a computer game or just a game, is an
          electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or
          input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion
          sensing device) to generate visual feedback from a display device,
          most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer
          monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a
          virtual reality headset.

          Video games are typically categorized according to their hardware
          platform, which traditionally includes arcade video games, console
          games, and computer (PC) games; the latter also encompasses LAN games,
          online games, and browser games. More recently, the video game
          industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through mobile devices (such
          as smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and augmented reality
          systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are also classified into
          a wide range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target
          audience.
